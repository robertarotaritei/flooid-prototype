            Flōōid (https://flooid.eu/) is a start-up company based in the Benelux with co-working offices in Antwerp, Eindhoven and Alkmaar, and Partner In Innovation of Fontys.  Flōōid’s value proposition is a model for community-based 
            learning and innovation, supported by a networking platform that brings together organizations, people and projects. 
            This platform is in essence a knowledge graph where various “knowledge hubs” such as Breda Universities of Applied Sciences, 
            Delft University of Technology, MindLabs, Fontys will be able to discover information via a web interface powered by AI (in 
            particular, Natural Language Processing). This idea originated and is being developed as part of the “Digital Realities” 
            (DigiReal) research project.
